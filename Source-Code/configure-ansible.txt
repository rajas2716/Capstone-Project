 Ansible can help you with configuration management, application deployment, task automation.

Steps to configure ansible on Control-Server and the client machine

PREREQUISITES

	INSTALL PYTHON AND PYTHON-PIP

	apt install python                    // For linux-like systems
	apt install python-pip

	INSTALL ANSIBLE

	pip install ansible


------------STEPS--------------------

1. Add user in both the control-server and the client machine

	  useradd -m -d /home/ansadmin/ -s /bin/bash -G sudo ansadmin

	  passwd ansadmin  //Creates password for ansadmin user

2. Allow ssh on both machines by changing sshd_config file (For both client and control-server)

	cd /etc/ssh
	vi sshd_config
	Change 'PasswordAuthentication' to yes

3. Restart sshd service 

	restart sshd service

4. Make a rule for changing root user privileges for both client and control-server in user ansadmin

	visudo
	
	ansadmin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

5. Login as ansadmin on your control-server and create ssh-key for ssh connection configuration

	ssh-keygen

6. Copy ssh key to the client user for password less ssh by the ansible api

	ssh-copy-id ansadmin@{{ip_address_of_client}}

7. Try to ssh into the client from the control-server

	ssh ansadmin@{{ip_address_of_client}}

8. Add host file in /etc/ansible/hosts

	[master-node]
	ansadmin@{{ipaddress-of-master-node}}
 
9. Ping all ansible clients stored in the hosts file

	ansible all -m ping
